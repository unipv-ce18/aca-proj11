= Parallelizing Mathematical Morphology
D.Lietavec  L.Zanussi (Advanced Computer Architecture 2018-2019)


__
Our project for the course consisted in the creation and the subsequent parallelization of a set of Mathematical
Morphology operators — the result is a C++ codebase depending on OpenCV (only for image I/O); OpenMP was also used
to manage the thread pool and initially plan the parallel execution of the kernel.
We will then discuss about switching to a custom planning algorithm, and observe the results.

== Morphological operators

Mathematical Morphology is a branch of Computer Vision act to the analysis and processing of
geometrical structures. Where needed, parallelization of these algorithms combined with the use of the right CPU
features allows to achieve real-time HD video processing in less than 25ms.
The first thing we did was to perform some research on the topic, we then picked the operators we wanted to implement and write a first concept implementation in MATLAB.
