=== Comparing compilers

Another experiment is to measure the performance of the binary produced by different toolchains. GCC and LLVM Clang
are free and open source compilers available for all major platforms, while Microsoft's optimizing compiler `cl` is
part of the Visual Studio toolchain.

All binaries were compiled in release mode optimized for maximum speed (`-O3` in GCC and Clang, `/O2` for cl).
All the tools were at their latest version at the time of this writing.

It is interesting to note that Clang performs slightly better than GCC with no use of SIMD instructions, while GCC
outperforms it when SIMD is on. The trend remains with smaller images, where Clang's speedup in non-SIMD kernels
becomes more noticeable.

Even after additional research we weren't able to get any faster build from MSVC.

NOTE: MSVC's ABI is not compatible with GCC and Clang, dependencies like OpenCV need to be re-compiled for each ABI.
